# Duplication File Finder Application
## Duplicate File Finder with Rust programming language 
Often times we all face a dreatful message: "Storage space running low". What we're prone to do is delete items such as documents, files, or pictures without even thinking what is taking up our space in memory. But what if we focus on a hidden reason:  duplivate files. 

With Duplicate File Finder, you can easily detect and remove duplicate files, giving you a clean, organized system and more room for what really matters. Duplicate files silently steal your storage, create chaos in your workflow, and make managing your files a nightmare. Whether youâ€™re a developer, photographer, or student, Duplicate File Finder will:

-Free up storage space by identifying redundant files.
-Simplify file organization by grouping duplicates.
-Save time with fast and efficient file hashing.
